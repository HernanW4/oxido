# Progress Check
This section will help me to see my progress and keep track of my progress.

[] Mean TODO
[X] Mean Done

[] Lighting:
    [X] Make light source
    [] Modify fragment, and vertex shader to use normals
    [] Learn about important lighting concepts, ambient, diffuse, and what no.

I'm putting this two separate as they both required me to change much of the 
structure of the code. I now make most of my objects in blender and translate 
them back to glium by using obj-rs.
    [X] Learn how normals work
    [X] Calculate normals from given vertices
